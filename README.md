Hack Duke Fall 2014: Flash Aid
==============================
Flash Aid: Pushing the limits of emergency medical response by crowdsourcing community first responders.

Flash Aid enhances the emergency medical response time of a community by crowdsourcing
citizen first responders. Users may register for the app, enabling them to both offer
their assistance or expertise to others in their community, and request assistance from
other community members.

In the event of a real medical emergency, members of the community that are CPR certified
or carry an EpiPen, for example, can often respond significantly quicker than can an ambulance,
saving valuable minutes and potentially saving lives. A user experiencing an emergency or a bystander
can request immediate medical assistance, and the system will instantly alert nearby citizen first responders
and assist them in navigating to the emergency. The application will then automatically call the local
emergency number (911) for professional medical assistance. The entire process takes less than 15 seconds to
complete.

Without blood flow to the brain, permanent brain damage or death can occur in less than 8 minutes.
The typical _target_ response time for a 911 call is approximately 9 minutes. In the optimal case
where the ambulance actually achieves this response time, permanent brain damage may have already occurred.

Flash Aid enables citizens to respond to emergencies when an ambulance cannot. Flash Aid has the potential to
save lives. When every minute counts, sometimes 9 minutes just isn't acceptable.
